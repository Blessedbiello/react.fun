# üèÜ react.fun - Hackathon Submission

## Project Information

**Project Name:** react.fun - Multi-Chain Token Launchpad
**Category:** Innovation Track (Main Track)
**Team:** [Your Team Name]
**Submission Date:** [Date]
**Demo Video:** [YouTube Link - Under 5 minutes]

## üìã Executive Summary

**react.fun** is the world's first true multi-chain token launchpad where users launch tokens **once** and they're instantly tradeable on multiple chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Base) with **unified pricing** maintained by Reactive Smart Contracts.

**Why This Is Impossible Without RSCs:**

Traditional multi-chain launches require centralized relayers, expensive bridges, and 5-15 minute delays. RSCs enable **autonomous, trustless, real-time** coordination across chains that is literally impossible to achieve securely any other way.

## üéØ Problem & Solution

### The Problem

**Current Multi-Chain Token Launches Are Broken:**

1. **Fragmented Liquidity:**
   - Want token on Ethereum? Deploy, market, build liquidity
   - Want it on Polygon too? Start over completely
   - Want BSC too? Start over again
   - Result: Fragmented liquidity, inconsistent pricing, 3x effort

2. **Price Inconsistencies:**
   - Each chain has different price due to independent curves
   - Arbitrage bots profit from discrepancies
   - Users get poor execution
   - No unified market

3. **Centralization Required:**
   - Traditional solutions need centralized relayers
   - Trust assumptions in oracle operators
   - High operational costs
   - Single points of failure

### Why Traditional Solutions Don't Work

**Option 1: Bridges**
- ‚ùå High bridge fees (1-3% per transfer)
- ‚ùå 15-30 minute delays
- ‚ùå Security risks (bridge hacks are common)
- ‚ùå Still requires manual deployment on each chain

**Option 2: Centralized Relayers**
- ‚ùå Requires trust in operators
- ‚ùå 5-15 minute update delays
- ‚ùå High operational costs
- ‚ùå Can be censored or fail

**Option 3: Manual Management**
- ‚ùå Requires constant monitoring
- ‚ùå Slow reaction to market conditions
- ‚ùå Human error prone
- ‚ùå Not scalable

### The react.fun Solution

**Using Reactive Smart Contracts:**

1. **Launch Once, Deploy Everywhere:**
   ```
   User ‚Üí OriginFactory.createMultiChainToken([ETH, POLY, BSC])
   ‚Üí CrossChainLaunchCoordinator RSC detects event
   ‚Üí RSC emits 3 callbacks to deploy on all chains
   ‚Üí Token live on 3 chains in seconds
   ```

2. **Unified Pricing:**
   ```
   Trade on Ethereum ‚Üí UnifiedPriceOracle RSC detects
   ‚Üí RSC calculates volume-weighted average price
   ‚Üí RSC emits callbacks to sync price on Polygon + BSC
   ‚Üí Prices synchronized across all chains (sub-second)
   ```

3. **Coordinated Migration:**
   ```
   Market cap hits $69K on any chain ‚Üí LiquidityAggregator RSC aggregates
   ‚Üí RSC detects global threshold met
   ‚Üí RSC triggers DEX migration on ALL chains simultaneously
   ‚Üí Coordinated multi-chain graduation
   ```

### Why This REQUIRES Reactive Smart Contracts

**Without RSCs:** Impossible to achieve securely

- Need constant off-chain monitoring (expensive, centralized)
- Manual price updates (slow, error-prone)
- Bridge fees for every cross-chain action (expensive)
- Trust in oracle operators (centralized)

**With RSCs:** Native blockchain automation

- ‚úÖ Autonomous monitoring of all chains 24/7
- ‚úÖ Real-time event processing (sub-second)
- ‚úÖ Direct callback execution (no bridges)
- ‚úÖ Fully trustless and decentralized
- ‚úÖ Self-perpetuating (runs indefinitely when funded)

**This is literally impossible to build securely without Reactive Network.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### 3-Layer System

**Layer 1: Origin Contracts (Multi-Chain)**
- Deploy on: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Base
- Components:
  - `OriginTokenFactory.sol` - Emits LaunchRequest events
  - `OriginBondingCurve.sol` - Emits Trade/Price events
  - `OriginLaunchToken.sol` - ERC20 with cross-chain metadata

**Layer 2: Reactive Smart Contracts (Reactive Network - Chain ID 1597)**
- 6 RSCs working in coordination:
  1. **CrossChainLaunchCoordinator** - Orchestrates multi-chain deployment
  2. **UnifiedPriceOracle** - Synchronizes prices across chains
  3. **ArbitragePrevention** - Detects and prevents price discrepancies
  4. **LiquidityAggregator** - Tracks total market cap and triggers migration
  5. **SecurityGuardian** - Monitors for suspicious activity
  6. **TreasuryManager** - Aggregates fees from all chains

**Layer 3: Destination Contracts (Multi-Chain)**
- Same chains as Layer 1
- Components:
  - `DestinationDeployer.sol` - Receives deployment callbacks
  - `DestinationPriceSync.sol` - Updates prices from RSC
  - `DestinationMigrator.sol` - Handles DEX migrations

---

## üìù Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Token Launch Flow

**Step 1:** User calls `OriginTokenFactory.createMultiChainToken()`
- Input: name, symbol, description, imageUrl, targetChains[]
- Output: Token + BondingCurve deployed on origin chain
- Event: `LaunchRequest` emitted

**Step 2:** CrossChainLaunchCoordinator RSC detects event
- RSC subscribed to LaunchRequest on all chains
- react() function receives event
- Stores launch metadata

**Step 3:** RSC triggers deployment on target chains
- For each target chain:
  - Creates callback payload with token metadata
  - Emits Callback event to DestinationDeployer
  - Network executes callback on destination chain

**Step 4:** DestinationDeployer receives callback
- Verifies ReactVM authorization
- Deploys token + bonding curve using CREATE2
- Emits TokenDeployed event

**Result:** Token is live on all selected chains!

### 2. Trading & Price Sync Flow

**Step 1:** User calls `OriginBondingCurve.buy()`
- Input: ETH amount
- Contract calculates tokens out
- Updates curve state
- Event: `TokenPurchase` emitted with new price

**Step 2:** UnifiedPriceOracle RSC detects trade
- Receives TokenPurchase event
- Updates price tracking for this chain
- Calculates volume-weighted unified price across all chains

**Step 3:** RSC checks price deviation
- Compares each chain's price to unified price
- If deviation > 0.5%, triggers sync

**Step 4:** RSC emits price sync callbacks
- For each chain with price deviation:
  - Creates callback to DestinationPriceSync
  - Includes new unified price

**Step 5:** DestinationPriceSync updates price
- Receives callback
- Calls bondingCurve.syncPriceFromChain()
- Price is synchronized

**Result:** Prices stay in sync across all chains!

### 3. Migration Flow

**Step 1:** Market cap threshold reached
- Any chain's bonding curve checks market cap
- If >= $69K, emits MigrationThresholdReached

**Step 2:** LiquidityAggregator RSC aggregates
- Receives events from all chains
- Calculates total market cap across chains
- Confirms global threshold met

**Step 3:** RSC triggers coordinated migration
- For each chain:
  - Emits callback to DestinationMigrator
  - Includes token address

**Step 4:** DestinationMigrator executes
- Calls bondingCurve.migrateToDEX()
- Creates DEX pair
- Adds liquidity
- Locks curve tokens

**Result:** Simultaneous DEX graduation across all chains!

## üí∞ REACT Usage & Longevity

### Gas Consumption per Operation

**Per Launch (3 chains):**
- LaunchRequest detection: 1 RSC activation
- Deployment callbacks: 3 √ó REACT burn
- Initial sync: 3 √ó REACT burn
- **Total: ~8-10 REACT**

**Per Trade:**
- Price oracle: 1 RSC activation
- Sync callbacks: 2 √ó REACT burn
- Security check: 1 RSC activation
- **Total: ~4-5 REACT**

**Per Migration:**
- Aggregation: 1 RSC activation
- Migration callbacks: 3 √ó REACT burn
- **Total: ~4-5 REACT**

### Daily Projections

**Conservative (Early Stage):**
- 20 launches √ó 10 REACT = 200 REACT
- 500 trades √ó 5 REACT = 2,500 REACT
- 2 migrations √ó 5 REACT = 10 REACT
- **Total: ~2,710 REACT/day**

**At Scale:**
- 100 launches √ó 10 REACT = 1,000 REACT
- 5,000 trades √ó 5 REACT = 25,000 REACT
- 10 migrations √ó 5 REACT = 50 REACT
- **Total: ~26,050 REACT/day**

### Sustainability

The system can run **indefinitely** as long as RSCs are funded with REACT:
- Self-perpetuating economic model
- Platform fees can fund RSC operations
- High volume = high sustainability
