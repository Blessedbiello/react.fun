## 🏗️ **Smart Contract Deployment**

### **Step 1: Deploy Secure Contracts**
Deploy order (CRITICAL - follow exactly):
1. `LaunchToken` implementation
2. `SecureHyperBondingCurve` implementation
3. `TokenFactory` (references both implementations)

### **Step 2: Contract Configuration**
```solidity
// Update these addresses after deployment:
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
    TOKEN_FACTORY: "0x...", // TokenFactory address
    PLATFORM_FEE_RECIPIENT: "0x...", // Your fee collection address
}
```

### **Step 3: Multi-Sig Setup** 🔐
**CRITICAL**: Use multi-signature wallet for admin functions
```bash
# Recommended: 3-of-5 multi-sig
# Signers:
# - 2x Core team members
# - 1x External security consultant
# - 1x Community representative
# - 1x Emergency backup key (cold storage)
```

### **Step 4: Initial Parameters**
```solidity
// Conservative launch parameters:
CURVE_SUPPLY = 800_000_000e18;      // 800M tokens on curve
MIGRATION_THRESHOLD = 69_000e18;     // $69K market cap
PLATFORM_FEE_BPS = 100;             // 1% platform fee
MIN_PURCHASE_AMOUNT = 0.001 ether;   // $0.10 minimum
MAX_PURCHASE_AMOUNT = 10 ether;      // $1000 maximum
MEV_PROTECTION_BLOCKS = 2;           // 2-block MEV delay
```

---

## 💻 **Frontend Deployment**

### **Environment Configuration**
```typescript
// Update frontend/lib/config.ts
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  TOKEN_FACTORY: "0xDeployedFactoryAddress", // Update after deployment
} as const

// Production environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID=5031
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME="Somnia Mainnet"
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL="https://api.infra.mainnet.somnia.network/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_URL="https://explorer.somnia.network/"
```

### **Deployment Pipeline**
```bash
# Production build and deploy
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run start

# Or deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### **Security Headers**
```javascript
// next.config.ts - Add security headers
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
    value: 'on'
  },
  {
    key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
    value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
    value: 'nosniff'
  },
  {
    key: 'Referrer-Policy',
    value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'
  },
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline';"
  }
]
```

## 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics Setup**

### **On-Chain Monitoring**
```bash
# Set up event monitoring
# Monitor these critical events:
# - TokenPurchase (volume tracking)
# - TokenSale (sell pressure)
# - CurveMigration (graduations)
# - EmergencyPause (security incidents)
```

### **Infrastructure Monitoring**
```yaml
# Recommended tools:
# - DataDog: Application performance monitoring
# - Sentry: Error tracking and performance
# - LogRocket: User session replay
# - PagerDuty: Incident response
```

### **Security Alerts**
```typescript
// Critical alert thresholds:
interface SecurityThresholds {
  LARGE_TRANSACTION: 100 ether,      // Alert on >$10K trades
  PRICE_MANIPULATION: 10,            // Alert on >10% price change
  FAILED_TRANSACTIONS: 50,           // Alert on >50 failed txs/hour
  EMERGENCY_PAUSE: true              // Immediate alert on pause
}
```

## 🎯 **Launch Strategy**

### **Soft Launch (Week 1)**
- Deploy on mainnet with conservative limits
- Whitelist early users only
- Monitor for 48 hours before public launch
- Set lower transaction limits initially

### **Public Launch (Week 2)**
- Announce on social media
- Remove transaction limits gradually
- Monitor security metrics closely
- Have emergency pause ready

### **Scale-Up (Week 3+)**
- Increase limits based on usage patterns
- Add advanced features
- Community governance integration
- Cross-chain expansion planning

---

## 🔧 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Emergency Pause Protocol**
```solidity
// Immediate response to security threats:
1. Execute emergency pause (< 1 block response time)
2. Notify all users via frontend banner
3. Investigate root cause
4. Prepare fix if needed
5. Resume operations with community approval
```

### **Incident Response Team**
```
Primary: Lead Developer (24/7 monitoring)
Secondary: Security Consultant
Backup: Community Multi-sig
Communication: Social media manager
```

### **Emergency Contacts**
```
Critical Issues: security@spawn.fun
General Support: support@spawn.fun
Community: Discord/Telegram channels
Public Updates: Twitter/X announcements
```

## 💰 **Fee Structure & Revenue**

### **Revenue Model**
```typescript
// Platform revenue streams:
PLATFORM_FEE = 1%;           // On all trades
CREATOR_FEE = 2%;            // To token creators
MIGRATION_FEE = 0.5%;        // On DEX graduation
```

### **Fee Collection**
```solidity
// Automated fee distribution:
- 70% to platform treasury
- 20% to development fund
- 10% to community rewards
```

**🎉 Ready for Launch!**

spawn.fun is now security-hardened and ready for professional audit and production deployment. The platform combines the viral nature of pump.fun with the lightning-fast performance of Somnia Network.

**Next Step**: Schedule professional security audit with a tier-1 firm before mainnet launch.

*Total estimated timeline: 4-6 weeks from audit initiation to full production launch.*
